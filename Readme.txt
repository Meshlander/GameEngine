Large 3d engine project based upon and 
deriving from the early episodes of Handmade Hero,
(meaning that many parts of the code have been copied
watching the show directly, for self educational purposes)
and the work of Casey Muratori. It is also a 
spiritual continuation of his work; the engine will aim to
satisfy educational purposes creating a "white box like"
3d game engine, in which both rendering and sound are done 
in an oldschool software accelerated way,
to help students later understand what OpenGl, and other
"black box like" entities are doing.

The implementation of quaternions, a presently not showcased 
skeletal animation, a wireframe drawer, and networking are
my own additions to the code.

Use WASD and mouse look. Due to a networking bug the game
is slow atm, and server -> game -> game connection can
crash and fail.
